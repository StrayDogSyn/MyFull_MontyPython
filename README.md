# MyFull_MontyPython

My first in a series of Python independent projects that I have been working on through my Tech Pathways and independent studies.

## TabletopInventory

This project includes an inventory management system for tabletop RPG characters. There are two versions available:

1. **tabletop_inventory.py** - A GUI-based version using PyQt6
2. **tabletop_text.py** - A text-based version for terminals

## Character Data

The project includes a sample character:

- **pasa_phist.json** - A pre-configured character for demonstration purposes

## Usage

To run the GUI version:

```bash
python tabletop_inventory.py
```

To run the text-based version:

```bash
python tabletop_text.py
```
